# Chinese-Zodiac-Calculator
Latest Update: March 29, 2023

🇨🇳 All images used in this application are created by me.

🇨🇳 GUI is created with Tkinter.

🇨🇳 This application will let you know your Chinese zodiac sign after you input your birth year. I am aware that there are different theories on the starting date of a new zodiac sign, some say it’s January 1st on lunar calendar, some say it’s the Beginning of Spring day. To be honest, most Chinese people (at least most people I know) simply just count by Gregorian calendar year. Thus for simplicity’s sake, this application will use Gregorian calendar year.

⭐️ For rule followers:
👏🏻 Enter the birth year, click the “Calculate” button or hit Enter on your keyboard, you will see your Chinese zodiac sign being displayed.

⭐️ For rule breakers:
😭 If what you entered has symbol(s) and/or letter(s), you will be asked to provide a valid year.
😭 If the year you entered is 0, you will be asked to provide a valid year.
😭 If the year you entered is greater or equal to 10,000, you will be greeted by a friendly alien, asking are you from the future.
